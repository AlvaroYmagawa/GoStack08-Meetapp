# Challenge 02. 

Create an application from scratch using Express.

In this application configure the following tools:

- Sucrase + Nodemon;
- ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig;
- Sequelize (Use PostgresSQL or MySQL);

During this challenge you will start a new project in Bootcamp, this project will be developed gradually until the end of your journey where you will have a complete application involving backend, frontend and mobile.

This project will also be used for bootcamp certification, so let's go for the code!

## Aplication

The application we will start development from now on is a developer event aggregator app called Meetapp (an acronym for Meetup + App).

In this first challenge we will create some basic functionality that we have learned throughout the classes so far.

## Functionalities

Below are the features you should add to your application.

### Authentication

Allow a user to authenticate to your application using email and password.

- Authentication must be done using JWT.
- Perform input data validation;

### Registering and Updating Users

Allow new users to sign up for your application using name, email and password.

To update the password, the user must also submit a confirmation field with the same password.

- Encrypt the user's password for security.
- Perform input data validation;
